Narrow, shoulder-width dips primarily train the triceps, with major synergists being the anterior deltoid, the pectoralis muscles (sternal, clavicular, and minor), and the rhomboid muscles of the back (in that order).[1] Wide arm training places additional emphasis on the pectoral muscles, similar in respect to the way a wide grip bench press would focus more on the pectorals and less on the triceps.","muscleGroup":"Chest","apiId":781},{"name":"Fly With Cable","set":4,"rep":12,"weight":50.0,"description":"","muscleGroup":"Chest","apiId":122},{"name":"Barbell Bench Press","set":99999,"rep":999,"weight":999.0,"description":"Bench pressing heavy things using heavy objects","muscleGroup":"Chest","apiId":581},{"name":"Flys","set":54,"rep":54,"weight":54.0,"description":"A fly or flye is a strength training exercise in which the hand and arm move through an arc while the elbow is kept at a constant angle. Flies are used to work the muscles of the upper body. Because these exercises use the arms as levers at their longest possible length, the amount of weight that can be moved is significantly less than equivalent press exercises for the same muscles.","muscleGroup":"Chest","apiId":785},{"name":"Arms","set":123,"rep":123,"weight":123.0,"description":"\u003cp\u003eArms exercise sdfg asdg asf sdfg sdfg sdfgsdf gsdf g sgsdf gsdfg sdfg alk fl;asdf ;ansd;kf na;klsdnfla nsd l;knalksdf adsfadsf a\u003c/p\u003e","muscleGroup":"Chest","apiId":478},{"name":"Arms","set":123,"rep":123,"weight":123.0,"description":"\u003cp\u003eArms exercise sdfg asdg asf sdfg sdfg sdfgsdf gsdf g sgsdf gsdfg sdfg alk fl;asdf ;ansd;kf na;klsdnfla nsd l;knalksdf adsfadsf a\u003c/p\u003e","muscleGroup":"Chest","apiId":478}]},{"name":"Tuesday","exercises":[{"name":"Bicep Curl Dumbell (Prise Hammer)","set":3,"rep":12,"weight":60.0,"description":"\u003cp\u003ePrendre les dumbells en prise neutre ou hammer et les soulevers au niveau des Ã©paules redescendre doucement.
